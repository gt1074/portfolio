Gavin Tucker's Portfolio.
Normally [Lives here](https://d30iaq9iwb0kwc.cloudfront.net/), but is not currently up.

Contains models that link to projects I have worked on.
Currently not linked together.

Github Actions:
1. Correctly set up npm​
2. Webpack the dependencies​
3. Sync only the necessary folders to s3​
4. Invalid CloudFront's cache so users always see up to date portfolio
